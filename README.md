# ü§ñ Agentic AI Franchise Data Enrichment System

## Overview

This project is an **Agentic AI-powered** franchise data enrichment system that autonomously enhances franchise information through intelligent web scraping and AI-driven contact discovery. The system leverages Stagehand's agentic AI capabilities to navigate complex web interactions, extract corporate data from OpenCorporates, and discover real-time contact information using advanced AI search. The result is a fully automated pipeline that transforms raw franchise data into comprehensive, enriched business intelligence for FDD (Franchise Disclosure Document) analysis, supply chain optimization, and vendor management.

### Confidence Score Calculation
The confidence score (0.0-1.0) represents the system's confidence in the accuracy of each enriched record. It's calculated as:

**Formula**: `(Number of Good Fields) / 6`

**Fields Evaluated** (6 total):
1. **Corporate Name** (from OpenCorporates)
2. **Corporate Address** (from OpenCorporates) 
3. **Franchisee Owner** (from OpenCorporates)
4. **Corporate Phone** (from Perplexity AI)
5. **Corporate Email** (from Perplexity AI)
6. **LinkedIn URL** (from Perplexity AI)

**"Good Field" Criteria**:
- Value is not empty (`""`)
- Value is not "N/A"
- For contact fields: Value is not the fallback default

**Score Interpretation:**
- **0.83**: 5/6 good fields - High confidence
- **0.67**: 4/6 good fields - Good confidence  
- **0.50**: 3/6 good fields - Moderate confidence
- **0.33**: 2/6 good fields - Low confidence
- **0.17**: 1/6 good fields - Very low confidence
- **0.00**: 0/6 good fields - No enrichment success
